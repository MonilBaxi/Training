CON-6795:Update lock / unlock padlock icon
Description
New users struggle to identify the meaning of the padlock and knowing that they need to unlock it to start to build a wallboard. This has been fed back from the sales team and identified during UX user testing sessions.

Requirement:
When the padlock is locked (and wallboard cannot be edited) show the word ‘Edit’ next to the icon to identify that the user needs to click to edit the wallboard
The user should be able to click the padlock, the word or the space in between to unlock the wallboard
When the padlock is un-locked (and wallboard is being edited) show the word ‘Save’ next to the icon to identify that the user needs to click to save the wallboard
The user should be able to click the padlock, the word or the space in between to lock the wallboard


CON-5492:Make wallboard options clickable not just the icons
Details:

Requirement:
Make whole button clickable with hover state rather than just the icon on the button
Rename the text for “Queues” option to “Call Queue”

CON-7471:Importing workitem validator does not strip whitespace
Description
When you import a workitem csv, I kept getting an error about the date field not being in the right format.
The format asked for was YYYYMMDD, so I was 100% sure that 20220407 matched that exactly.
And it would of if I removed all the spaces between the delimiters. But when you write a csv, you add spaces to make it readable. 
The validate should always be striping whitespace on those type of fields.
